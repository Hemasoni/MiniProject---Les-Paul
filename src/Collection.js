    <h2>LES PAUL GUITAR COLLECTION</h2>
    <p id="p1">
    Below is a glimpse at a few of the hundreds of Les Paul’s guitars. His guitar collection, like his career, spans 8 decades. Les started playing guitar in the 1920s and his earliest guitars, like his L-5, would’ve been new at the time he purchased it them. As his musical career evolved, so did his guitars. Les modified, innovated and created guitars to suit his needs. In addition, other renowned guitar players including Segovia and Django Reinhardt gave Les Paul guitars out of respect and camaraderie.
